# Finance Goal Tracker Idea

This project entered in my mind when I'm doing my financial recording on Excel with basic stuff but pretty handy visualisation of my progress and goal.

I wanted to create this for myself, and hopefully someone can use this for their financial goal as well. This app is for personal and private use only, It will `not require you to connect your bank account or credit card` just input numbers there and the app will do the work for you.
